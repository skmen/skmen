### Hi there 👋

<!--
**skmen/skmen** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- 🔭 I’m currently working at Mastercard as an SDET for their mobile sdks
- 🌱 I’m always learning but currently I'm focused on API testing and expanding my approaches to UI automation
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on automation work and security testing
